//! Day 13's problem is the first that I could not solve within 2 hours
//!
//! The main difficulty (using Rust) lies with parsing the inputs. I can come
//! up with two major ways to parse them:
//!
//! - Implement my own data structure
//! - Use some JSON reader
//!
//! The first approach carries with it the insurmountable challenge of writing
//! an input parser (basically). The second approach was also not great since
//! I am not familiar with the JSON parser packages. In any case, I ran out of
//! time to go with either approach on the night this puzzle came out,
//! but there are two interesting things to learn about that I hope to get to
//! after the competition is fully over.
//!
//! 1. Write an actual JSON serializer and deserializer in Rust as a side proj
//! 2. Learn to use the serde_json crate

fn main() {
    println!("Come back later!");
}
